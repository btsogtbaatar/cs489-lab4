# Lab 3 Part 2

1. What is Spring?

    Spring is a Java platform that supports infrastructure for you, so you don't need to worry about infrastructure.

    For example: Spring provides the dependency injection through its core container, data access through its ORM (Hibernate), web functionality through its web module, and testing through its testing module.

2. What is Spring Boot?

    Spring boot is an open-source tool that makes it easier to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.

    For example: It automatically configures your application based on dependencies you installed through its auto-configuration functionality.

3. What is the relation between the Spring platform and Spring Boot?

    Spring Boot is based on Spring Platform which makes it even easier to develop Spring applications.

    For example: It provides embedded servers, so you don't need to deploy your application to an external server.

4. What is the relation between the Spring platform and the Spring framework?

    The term Spring platform refers Spring framework itself. Maybe it is referring Spring ecosystem that gives a lot of options of tools you can use to develop the Spring application.

    For example: Spring Boot is one of the tools of Spring Ecosystem that developers use to build Spring applications.

5. What is Dependency Injection and how is it done in the Spring platform/framework?

    Dependency Injection is done through Spring beans in the Spring platform.

    For example: Every object and its dependencies, and associations in the Spring application can be configured by Spring Beans.

6. What is Inversion of Control (IoC) and how is it related to Spring?

    IoC is a design principle used in software development. In the traditional sense,nse, a flow of execution is determined by a program itself. However, in IoC, frameworks or external components are in control of determining the flow of execution of the program's execution.

    For example: To determine a policy of security in Spring Framework, you will extend a class that is implemented in Spring Framework.
